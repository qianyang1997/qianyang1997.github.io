I'm a graduate student at Northwestern University, pursuing an M.S degree in Analytics. My interest lies in media technology, natural langauge processing, policy research, musical theatre, classical literature, and anything at the intersection of AI and humanities. If I'm not writing Python scripts, I'm probably reading Ovid, Cicero, or the fantasy series I've been obsessed with since age 12 (as well as their never-ending sequels and prequels). Prior to grad school, I worked as a writer and analyst at a small but wonderful digital marketing agency in NC. Before that, I was a pianist and math major at Williams College.
