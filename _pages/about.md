I'm a master's student at Northwestern University studying analytics and data science. My interest lies in media technology, natural langauge processing, policy research, musical theatre, and anything related to books. If I'm not coding or spending the majority of my day on StackOverflow, I'm probably reading and rereading Kant, Emerson, or those fantasy series I've been obsessed with since 12 (as well as their never-ending sequels and prequels). Prior to grad school, I was working as a writer at a small but wonderful digital marketing agency in NC. And before that, I was a hardcore pianist and music & math double major at Williams College. 

Want to chat more about data science, politics, the benefits and struggles of a liberal arts education, or simply inquire about my top 3 Broadway musicals? [Email](mailto:qyang1997@outlook.com?subject=[GitHub]) me anytime.
