title: "A Computational Approach to Assessing News Trustworthiness in a Digital World"
excerpt: "Inspired by the plethora of machine learning models on fake new detection, my project aims to assess the correlation between certain rhetorical strategies and news readers' perception of bias and deception in online media sources. I will be primarily focusing on articles detailing the 2020 election."

Fake news detection is a popular use case of machine learning models in the areas of computational linguistics and cybersecurity. Given the democratization of technology in recent years and a decades-old trend toward greater polarization in political discourse, it is ever more important for news readers to develop a critical mindset, regardless of the reputation of the news source. To a large extent, machine learning and natural langauge processing methodologies have helped both content distributors and consumers discern fiction from truth. However, these models and algorithms still need a great degree of fine tuning, as the cultural and linguistic ecosystem of fake and misleading news will always be constantly evolving.

Problem Statement
-----------------

Most current literature in the field of computational disinformation research focuses on auto-detection of fake and misleading news, developing hard classfications based on predetermined labels. This approach, though highly reproducible and pragmatic, has its own limitations. For one, the concept of "neutral and non-partisan information" is difficult to define &dash; even the most matter-of-fact storytelling cannot be completely devoid of bias. In addition, our social and political system incentivizes discourse competition over accuracy. We as readers are so acclimated to the elements of rhetoric spectacle that our perception of truth is very likely to be subjective in the majority of cases. 

Because of these limitations and loose definitions, the task of labeling is a major challenge in the classification pipeline. Therefore, for this project, I would like to investigate how we as content consumers perceive the elements of bias and deception in political news. Rather than having machines "learn" the linguistic characteristics of fake news, I decide not to rely on a hard classification model. Instead, my goal is to assess the effect of certain rhetorical strategies and literary devices on readers' subjective assessment of bias and deception.
