title: "Assessing Patterns of Opioid Use, Misuse or Aberrant Use for Postoperative Pain"
excerpt: "With data collected from over 100 patients, we analyzed the quantity and frequency at which opioid- or valium-containing drugs were taken based on patients' verbal and written reports, electronic cap openings, and official medical records."

This project is a collaboration between Northwestern's Master of Science in Analytics program and Feinberg School of Medicine. The summary below provides an overview of our findings and methodologies. I'm hesitant to provide specific statistical information due to confidentiality concerns.

Executive Summary
-----------------

With opioid misuse as a fairly widespread issue in the Unites States, healthcare providers seek answers to how much opioid-containing medicine should be prescribed to properly manage patients' postoperative pain. Prescribing too many pills may invite drug misuse, while prescribing too few can potentially limit patient's access to essential pain control. This study attempts to investigate the optimal number of opioid-containing pills to be prescribed to adolescents undergoing appendectomy, spinal fusion or pectus repair surgeries. We have access to the medical records and self reports of over 100 patients who have opted in for the study. Based on the information we gathered, we will also discuss patterns of drug use after the patients were discharged, including but not limited to the effect of opioid- and valium-containing drugs on pain reduction and the degree of consistency between patients' self reports and official medical records. We hope our insights will help healthcare providers make more informed decisions when optimizing the prescription amount to avoid potential drug abuse, drug waste, or prolonged pain.

To analyze the effect of different classes of pain relievers on postoperative pain management, we relied on patients' self-reported pain scores on a scale of 1 to 5. To minimize individual bias, we normalized these pain scores and calculated percentage decrease case by case. Our analyses confirmed that opioid- and valium-containing drugs can effectively reduce pain at a statistically significant level. Patients who primarily used opioid-containing drugs reported higher levels of pain than those who relied on non-opioid-containing drugs. 

With regard to detecting patterns of use, misuse, and aberrant use from the provided data, we have concluded that neither patients’ self reports (diary and phone follow-up) nor records of electronic cap openings provide an objective view of how patients are taking opioid- or valium-containing drugs at home. This is because a) many patients or their immediate family members are fairly inconsistent with their diary entries, either reporting the wrong hours, medicine names and intake amounts or omitting an entire event, day, or week from the study period, and b) the official records of electronic cap openings do not necessarily reflect the quantity and frequency of pills taken by the patients at the recorded times. In a number of cases, we have observed patients taking multiple pills from the eCap bottle at the same time, retrieving multiple pills from the eCap bottles to be taken at a later time, or opening prescription bottles without using any of the pills. These patterns of behaviors appear to be occurring at random, with no correlation to demographics, pain scores, drug classes, or any of the other features in our data set. The inconsistency between these different sources of data has been a major challenge.

An additional challenge we faced is the limited size of the sample. Most statistical tests and prediction models require a decent-sized data set to generate reliable results. To compensate for some of the missing and inaccurate data from patients’ self reports, we employed data imputation methods based on our best judgment of how patients would likely have done in a missing entry given what we know about the patient’s other records. We will discuss data imputation in detail in Section 6.
